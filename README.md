<h1 align="center">Simple Library Management System</h1>
<h3 align="center">In this project, I created a library management prompt in Python. I used PyQt5 for the interface.
In the project, the library system keeps the book name, author's name, first publication date and page number as data. The data is kept in the books.txt file.
We have 4 windows: main menu, add book menu, delete book menu and show menu to see all in the list. I wanted to put a few photos from the application below.</h3>
